Alexa Account linking with enterprise systems  https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/0fbd9756-6ea0-43d5-b213-873ede1b0595/tips-for-successfully-adding-account-linking-to-your-alexa-skill

How this works
1.	Based on Oauth 2.0 specification
2.	Need to link Alexa with the Bank using a Oauth authentication system.
3.	Login details will be provided through a mobile friendly mobile page which will be rendered in Alexa app
4.	Once user successfully authenticated using the login screen, system will provide one authorization code
5.	Alexa will store this authorization code in Session and will pass that to backend systems whenever the skill is invoked.

Generally this is secured as 
1.	Amazon only accepts HTTPS communication to the login service.
2.	It is based on Authorization code – so no direct userid/password store in Amazon system
3.	We can extend the refresh token capability so that Authorization code expires after certain time and Alexa will refresh that by using refresh token service
4.	It is a standard in the industry and many other organizations are already using it effectively.

Next steps for CCB
1.	Need to check if CCB has any such service which is HTTPS and Public and able to generate Authorization code
2.	If not we need to extend the existing login services of CCB to expose one such HTTPS public service which suits Alexa requirement to link enterprise account.
